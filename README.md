Mirror of Climate
Mirror of Climate is a web-based platform developed by Team Shunya to address the 
urgent need for climate awareness. Our platform combines real-time environmental data, 
AI-driven interactions, and cutting-edge Augmented Reality (AR) to empower users to 
visualize climate impacts. Mirror of Climate serves as a mirror to reflect the current state 
of our environment, while encouraging education and action.

Mission Statement
We believe that by providing users with real-time data, educational resources, and 
immersive AR experiences, we can inspire a global community to take proactive measures 
against climate change. Mirror of Climate leverages NASA's data and modern 
technologies to create an interactive and impactful tool for climate awareness.

Key Features
